The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of <a href="/wiki/Modern_history" title="Modern history">modern history</a>, triggering the global decline of <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute monarchies</a> while replacing them with <a href="/wiki/Republics" class="mw-redirect" title="Republics">republics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_democracy" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracies</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Through the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="French Revolutionary Wars">Revolutionary Wars</a>, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.

		<p>The <a href="/wiki/Causes_of_the_French_Revolution" title="Causes of the French Revolution">causes of the French Revolution</a> are complex and are still debated among historians.

It attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes, which were heavily <a href="/wiki/Regressive_tax" title="Regressive tax">regressive</a>. Years of bad harvests leading up to the Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy and the Catholic clergy of the established church. Demands for change were formulated in terms of <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> ideals and contributed to the convocation of the <a href="/wiki/Estates_General_of_1789_in_France" class="mw-redirect" title="Estates General of 1789 in France">Estates General</a> in May 1789. During the first year of the Revolution, members of the <a href="/wiki/Estates_General_(France)" title="Estates General (France)">Third Estate</a> (commoners) took control, the <a href="/wiki/Storming_of_the_Bastille" title="Storming of the Bastille">Bastille was attacked</a> in July, the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> was passed in August, and a <a href="/wiki/The_Women%27s_March_on_Versailles" class="mw-redirect" title="The Women's March on Versailles">women's march on Versailles</a> that forced the royal court back to Paris in October.

		<p>External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_France" title="Military history of France">French victories</a> that facilitated the conquest of the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Peninsula" title="Italian Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Low_Countries" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a> and most territories west of the <a href="/wiki/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of <a href="/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre" title="Maximilien Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Jacobin_Club" class="mw-redirect" title="Jacobin Club">Jacobins</a>.

		<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction" title="Thermidorian Reaction">Thermidorian Reaction</a>, an executive council known as the <a href="/wiki/French_Directory" title="French Directory">Directory</a> assumed control of the French state in 1795.

Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, established the <a href="/wiki/French_Consulate" title="French Consulate">Consulate</a> and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.</p>,
		<p>The modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as <i><a href="/wiki/La_Marseillaise" title="La Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Libert%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_ou_la_mort" class="mw-redirect" title="Liberté, fraternité, égalité, ou la mort">Liberté, fraternité, égalité, ou la mort</a></i>, became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution" title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> over a century later.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>,
		<p>The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system, emancipation of the individual, a greater division of landed property, abolition of the privileges of noble birth, and nominal establishment of equality among men. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not only national, for it intended to benefit all humanity.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>,
		<p>Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies.

				<p>Over the course of the 18th century, there emerged what the philosopher <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas" title="Jürgen Habermas">Jürgen Habermas</a> called the idea of the "<a href="/wiki/Public_sphere" title="Public sphere">public sphere</a>" in France and elsewhere in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26-21">[21]</a></sup> Habermas argued that the dominant cultural model in 17th century France was a "representational" culture, which was based on a one-sided need to "represent" power with one side active and the other passive.<sup id="cite_ref-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26-21">[21]</a></sup> A perfect example would be the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles" title="Palace of Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a>, which was meant to overwhelm the senses of the visitor and convince one of the greatness of the French state and <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_26-21">[21]</a></sup> Starting in the early 18th century the "public sphere" was "critical" in that both sides were active.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Examples of the public sphere included newspapers, journals, masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs where people either in person or virtually via the printed word debated and discussed issues.<sup id="cite_ref-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_27_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_27-23">[23]</a></sup> In France, the emergence of the public sphere outside of the control of the state led to the shift from Versailles to Paris as the cultural capital of France.<sup id="cite_ref-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_27_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blanning,_T.C.W_page_27-23">[23]</a></sup> Likewise, while in the 17th century the court had decided what was culturally good and what was not, in the 18th century the opinion of the court mattered less and consumers became the arbiters of cultural taste.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> In the 1750s, during the <i>"<a href="/wiki/Querelle_des_Bouffons" title="Querelle des Bouffons">Querelle des Bouffons</a>"</i> over the question of the quality of Italian vs. French music, the partisans of both sides appealed to the French public "because it alone has the right to decide whether a work will be preserved for posterity or will be used by grocers as wrapping-paper".<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In 1782, Louis-Sébastien Mercier wrote: "The word court no longer inspires awe amongst us as in the time of Louis XIV. Reigning opinions are no longer received from the court; it no longer decides on reputations of any sort ... The court's judgments are countermanded; one says openly that it understands nothing; it has no ideas on the subject and could have none."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Inevitably, the belief that public opinion had the right to decide cultural questions instead of deferring to the court transformed itself into the demand that the public also have a say on political questions as well.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></p>,
				<p>The economy in the Ancien Régime during the years preceding the Revolution suffered from instability. The sequence of events leading to the Revolution included the national government's fiscal troubles caused by an inefficient tax system and expenditure on numerous large wars.<sup id="cite_ref-macroeconomics_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-macroeconomics-16">[16]</a></sup> The attempt to challenge British naval and commercial power in the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a> was a costly disaster, with the loss of <a href="/wiki/New_France" title="New France">France's colonial possessions in continental North America</a> and the destruction of the French Navy.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> French forces were rebuilt, and feeling bitter about having lost many of France's overseas colonies to the British Empire during the Seven Years' War, Louis XVI was eager to give the American rebels financial and military support. After the British surrender at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga" class="mw-redirect" title="Battle of Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a>, the French sent 10,000 troops and millions of dollars to the rebels.

				<p>France was experiencing such a severe economic depression that there wasn't enough food to go around. Poor harvests lasting several years and an inadequate transportation system both contributed to making food more expensive.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> As with most monarchies, the upper class was always insured a stable living, so while the rich remained very wealthy, the majority of the French population was starving. Many were so destitute that they couldn't even feed their families and resorted to theft or prostitution to stay alive. Meanwhile, the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis. While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch, in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition. While he did reduce government expenditures, opponents in the <i><a href="/wiki/Parlement" title="Parlement">parlements</a></i> successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms. The <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> had produced many writers, pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion. The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy, which in turn tried to repress the underground literature.<sup id="cite_ref-Doyle_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Doyle-29">[29]</a></sup></p>,
				<p>Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals. These included resentment of royal <a href="/wiki/Political_absolutism" class="mw-redirect" title="Political absolutism">absolutism</a>; resentment by peasants, labourers and the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> towards the traditional <a href="/wiki/Manorialism" title="Manorialism">seigneurial</a> privileges possessed by the nobility; resentment of the Catholic Church's influence over public policy and institutions; aspirations for <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" title="Freedom of religion">freedom of religion</a>; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy; aspirations for social, political and economic equality, and (especially as the Revolution progressed) <a href="/wiki/Republicanism" title="Republicanism">republicanism</a>; hatred of Queen <a href="/wiki/Marie-Antoinette" class="mw-redirect" title="Marie-Antoinette">Marie-Antoinette</a>, who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Austrian</a> spy; and anger towards the King for dismissing ministers, including finance minister <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Necker" title="Jacques Necker">Jacques Necker</a>, who were popularly seen as representatives of the people.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup></p>,
				<p><a href="/wiki/Freemasonry" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> played an important role in the revolution. Originally largely apolitical, Freemasonry was radicalised in the late 18th century through the introduction of higher grades, which emphasised themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Virtually every major player in the Revolution was a Freemason and these themes became the widely recognised slogan of the revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></p>
